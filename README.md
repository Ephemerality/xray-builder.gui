# X-Ray Builder GUI
A C# application that processes e-books to create an X-Ray file for the Amazon Kindle (Paperwhite, Voyage, Fire, Android app, etc).  
X-Ray files are built complete with chapter locations, excerpts, and notable clips.  

It will also build some extra metadata files:
* Author Profile - Enables "About the author" button
* Start Actions - "About this book" info which usually has a description of the book, author, and some recommendations
* End Actions - Pops up when you're done reading the book to provide recommendations on what to read next
