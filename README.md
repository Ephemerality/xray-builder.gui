# X-Ray Builder GUI
A C# application that processes e-books to create an X-Ray file for the Amazon Kindle (Paperwhite, Voyage, Fire).  
X-Ray files are built complete with chapter locations, excerpts, and notable clips.  
Thanks to darrenmcg, Author Profile, Start Actions, and End Actions files can also be built.
