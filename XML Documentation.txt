Now in the GUI version only, you can export your Shelfari data to an XML file and modify it yourself (or build it from scratch).
Once dumped to file, you can choose to use the XML instead of downloading from Shelfari.

Example of a 2 terms dumped to XML: 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ArrayOfTerm xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">

Explanation of different elements:
type: Can be either character or topic. People should obviously character, anything else should be a topic. Your Kindle may not load the X-Ray if you put something other than those 2.
name: Self-explanatory.
desc: The description you want to show for the term. Notice that quotation marks should be escaped with a backslash or your X-Ray will probably fail to load. 
src: Can be either wikipedia or shelfari. If it is not one of the 2, your description will not show in the X-Ray for that character.
url: Usually the Wikipedia or Shelfari link that points to either the term itself or the generic URL to the book.
matchCase: Can be true or false. Indicates whether the search should be case-sensitive. Characters and proper names are usually case-sensitive, while items or other glossary terms are not.
